# Hack the QMap!




Quantum computing has many exciting applications in chemistry, machine learning, and optimization – but we've only scratched the surface of the possibilities as a civilization, just like classical computing in the 1950s. We hope you all go on to do quantum algorithms research that will revolutionize every aspect of society for the better!

Today, though, we've got just 26 hours, and we'd like you to use a quantum computer to build a game, or a component of a game.

The possibilities should feel as big as the ones offered by your regular computer! A few ideas to juice your thinking:
* Use a quantum computer as a random number generator or noise source for
  - seeding behaviors
  - procedurally generating maps or music
* Use quantum logic itself as a gaming mechanism, whether for fun or education
* Apply Quantum Machine Learning to gameplay
* [Run Doom... on the universe?](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/qc)

You’ll be able to test your projects on a real ion trap quantum computer provided by IonQ (which [shoots lasers at individual atoms to compute](https://ionq.com/technology)).
*Remember that current devices are still NISQ, and noise can overtake the computation really fast. We recommend you experiment with circuits that use under a few dozen two-qubit gates.*
