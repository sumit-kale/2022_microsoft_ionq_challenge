## What is 'Hack the QMap'? 
Hack the QMap is a game powered by quantum computing where the players of the game have to build quantum circuits, gate by gate in each move of the game, to generate terrain which is as close to the original terrain generated by our quantum game engine!(circuits).

This game is the marriage between the two of the ideas of the IonQ + Microsoft Joint Challenge @ MIT iQuHACK 2022:
* Using a quantum computer for procedurally generate maps
* Using quantum logic itself as a gaming mechanism for both fun **AND** education!
